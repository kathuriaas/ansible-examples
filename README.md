# ansible-examples

This repo has multiple directories, each dedicated to a project (e.g. for postgres database installation/patching/maintenance, directory named "postgres" is created).

Each project contains a set of scripts, calling ansible playbooks. This strategy can be used in real life examples of using ansible.
